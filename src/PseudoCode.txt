Pseudo code


UI-element "run solver" (toggle) -> toggles the runSolver-Variable, which gets checked by the draw()-method.
private static runSolver = false;

UI-element: "solve all horizontal lines once"
UI-element: "solve all vertical lines once"



-> in draw-method: 
if runSolver = true {
  boolean successful = "solve all horizontal lines once“;
  if (successful) {
    redraw();
  }
  boolean successful = "solve all vertical lines once“;
  if (successful) {
    redraw();
  }

  run as long as you can do at the following two with finding a new box (black or white), then stop or do other methods
  if (!successful) {
    stop;
  }
}



UI-elements: show amount of boxes in each state:
- unknown boxes = 40;
- black boxes = 4;
- white boxes = 2;



setCrossedNumbers() {
  looks for new numbers to cross out
  (compare with markL, markR, markT, markB  and the State.BLACK)

checkIfNumbersAreStillPossible() {
  throw new Error, if the numbers don't have enough space anymore

checkWhiteBoxes() {
  if there is no number-mark in a box (horizontally OR vertically!!!), then it is white!!!
